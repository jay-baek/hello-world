## Something About Me:
I'm a curious explorer who's usually roving about somewhere whether it be in my notes, on the internet, in a book, or somewhere outside- be it examining the plants around me or a culture of people and their customs in another region of Earth.

I've recently become *quite* fond of programming and hope to interact with a community here that feels the same way.
